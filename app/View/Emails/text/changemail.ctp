Hello <?php echo $user['User']['first_name']; ?>,

You are receiving this e-mail because you have requested to change the address
that we have on file.

The old address in our system was:
<?php echo $user['User']['email']; ?>

The new address you specified was:
<?php echo $new_email; ?>

If you believe that this change was in error, please contact as soon as possible
so that we can sort things out.

Thank you,
